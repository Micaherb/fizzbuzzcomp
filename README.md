# fizzbuzzcomp
A solution to FizzBuzz without all those pesky modulus operators and if statements. Does that make it more efficient? Who knows?!

(I've found that the most time consuming part of both of these programs is the printing, the method of choosing what to print has almost no effect between the two programs, though I'm pretty sure fizzbuzz_ll.cpp is technically more efficient)
